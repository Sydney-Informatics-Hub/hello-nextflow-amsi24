# Hello Nextflow!

This workshop will put you on the path to writing your own reproducible and scalable scientific workflows using Nextflow. You will learn how to use core Nextflow components to build, run and troubleshoot a simple multi-step workflow.  


## Trainers  

* Fred Jaya, Sydney Informatics Hub, University of Sydney
* Ziad Al Bkhetan, Australian BioCommons
* Georgie Samaha, Sydney Informatics Hub, University of Sydney

## Prerequisites  

This is an intermediate workshop for people developing reproducuble bioinformatics workflows.

* Command line and linux skills are essential. The workshop will be conducted in a Unix environment.  
* (Strongly recommended) Experience developing reproducible workflows (e.g., bash, CWL, WDL, or Snakemake).  

## Set up requirements  

Please complete the [Setup](setup.md) instruction before the workshop. If you have any trouble, please get in contact with us ASAP via Slack.
