# Welcome

In this workshop, you will create a toy multi-step Nextflow workflow.

We will start by familiarizing ourselves with some common bash commands. Next, we will turn these commands into a small single-step Nextflow pipeline that will print a greeting to our terminal. In a series of exercises, we will then iterate on this pipeline to make it more flexible using variable outputs, inputs, and parameters.

As a bonus, we will add a second step to the pipeline to dynamically turn our greeting into uppercase letters and name pipeline outputs.

## Moving into your work directory  

It is good practice to organize projects into their own folders to make it easier to track and replicate experiments over time.

For this workshop, all work will be conducted in the `~/part1/` folder.

!!!question "Exercise"

    In the VSCode terminal, move into the directory for all Part 1 activities:

    ```bash
    cd ~/part1
    ```
