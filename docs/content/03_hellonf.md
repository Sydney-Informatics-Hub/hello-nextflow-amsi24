# Your first pipeline

!!! info "Learning objectives"

    1. Write your first  Nextflow pipeline
    2. Execute your first Nextflow pipeline and understand the outputs

Workflow languages are better than Bash scripts because they handle errors and run tasks in parallel more easily, which is important for complex jobs. They also have clearer structure, making it easier to maintain and work on with others.

Here, you're going learn more about the Nextflow language and take your first steps making **your first pipeline** with Nextflow.

We will convert the previous bash script example, running `hello_world.sh`,
into a small Nextflow pipeline. Through this exercise, you will be slowly 
introduced to the key components (and jargon!) required to make minimal working
pipeline.  

## The key components of a Nextflow pipeline

Nextflow pipelines need to be saved as `.nf` files. There are two key components
that need to be included in the `.nf` file:  

1. Process definitions  
2. A workflow definition  

> insert excalidraw  

The process definitions are comparable to a function in R or Python - it
contains instructions on what to run. To run a process, it must be included in
the workflow scope, like calling/running an R/Python function.  

### The `process` definition  

The process definition starts with the keyword `process`, followed by process name, and finally the process body delimited by curly braces. The process body must contain a `script` block which represents the command or, more generally, a script that is executed by it.

A process may contain any of the following definition blocks: `directives`, `inputs`, `outputs`, clauses, and of course, `script`.

```groovy
process < name > {
  [ directives ]

  input:
    < process inputs >

  output:
    < process outputs >

  script:
  """
  <script to be executed>
  """
}
```

### The `workflow` definition  

A workflow is a composition of processes and dataflow logic.

> what is dataflow  

The workflow definition starts with the keyword `workflow`, followed by an optional name, and finally the workflow body delimited by curly braces.

```
workflow {

    <example_process_1>
    <example_process_2>
    ...
    <example_process_N>

}
```

## `hello-world.nf`

Let's start creating our first Nextflow pipeline! We will create an empty `.nf`
file and build it up slowly to cover the key Nextflow concepts.

!!!question "Exercise"

    Create a new file called `hello-world.nf`.  


!!!question "Exercise"

    In the empty `hello-world.nf` script, add the following to the top of the
    file.

    ```groovy title="hello-world.nf"
    process SAYHELLO {

        script:
        """
        hello_world.sh
        """
    }
    ```

We have just defined a process called `SAYHELLO`, and instructed it to run
`hello_world.sh` bash script.  

> bash interpreter """ """

> move to bin dir

!!!question "Exercise"

    Add the `output` definition and process directive `debug`.

    ```groovy title="hello-world.nf" 
    process SAYHELLO {
        debug true

        output:
        stdout

        script:
        """
        hello_world.sh
        """
    }
    ```
The first piece of code (lines 1-11) describes a **process** called `SAYHELLO` with three definition blocks:

- **output**: directing outputs to be printed to `stdout` (standard output)
- **script**: the `echo 'Hello World!'` command

The second block of code (13-15) lines describes the **workflow** itself, which consists of one call to the `SAYHELLO` process.

## Commenting your code

It is worthwhile to **comment** your code so we, and others, can easily understand what the code is doing (you will thank yourself later).

In Nextflow, a single line comment can be added by prepending it with two forward slash (`//`):

```groovy
// This is my comment
```

Similarly, multi-line comments can be added using the following format:

```groovy
/*
 * Use echo to print 'Hello World!' to standard out
 */
```

As a developer you can to choose how and where to comment your code.

!!!question "Exercise"

    Add a comment to the pipeline to describe what the **process** block is doing

    ??? "Solution"

        The solution may look something like this:

        ```groovy title="hello-world.nf"
        /*
         * Use echo to print 'Hello World!' to standard out
         */
        process SAYHELLO {
        <truncated>
        ```

        Or this:

        ```groovy title="hello-world.nf"
        // Use echo to print 'Hello World!' to standard out
        process SAYHELLO {
        <truncated>
        ```

        As a developer, you get to choose!

## Executing `hello-world.nf`

The **`nextflow run`** command is used to execute Nextflow pipelines:

```bash
nextflow run <pipeline.nf>
```

When a pipeline is stored locally you need to supply the full path to the script. However, if the pipeline has been submitted to GitHub (and you have an internet connection) you can execute it without a local copy. For example, the **hello** repository hosted on the **nextflow-io** GitHub account can be executed using:

```bash
nextflow run nextflow-io/hello
```

!!!question "Exercise"

    Use the `nextflow run` command to execute `hello-world.nf`

    ???Solution

        ```bash
        nextflow run hello-world.nf
        ```

**Yay! You have just run your first pipeline!**

Your console should look something like this:

```console linenums="1"
N E X T F L O W  ~  version 23.10.1
Launching `hello-world.nf` [mighty_murdock] DSL2 - revision: 80e92a677c
executor >  local (1)
[4e/6ba912] process > SAYHELLO [100%] 1 of 1 âœ”
Hello World!
```

**What does each line mean?**

1. The version of Nextflow that was executed
2. The script and version names
3. The executor used (in the above case: local)
4. The first process is executed once, which means there is one task. The line starts with a unique hexadecimal value, and ends with the task completion information
5. The result string from stdout is printed

## Task directories

When a Nextflow pipeline is executed, a `work` directory is created. Processes are executed in isolated **task** directories. Each task uses a unique directory based on its [hash](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/cache-and-resume.html#task-hash) (e.g., `4e/6ba912`) within the work directory.

When a task is created, Nextflow stages the task input files, script, and other helper files into the task directory. The task writes any output files to this directory during its execution, and Nextflow uses these output files for downstream tasks and/or publishing.

These directories do not share a writable state, and any required files or information must be passed through channels (this will be important later).

!!!note

    You can execute `tree work` to view the work directory structure.

!!! warning

    The work directory might not have the same hash as the one shown above.

A series of files **log** files and any outputs are created by each task in the work directory:

- **`.command.begin`**: Metadata related to the beginning of the execution of the process task
- **`.command.err`**: Error messages (stderr) emitted by the process task
- **`.command.log`**: Complete log output emitted by the process task
- **`.command.out`**: Regular output (`stdout`) by the process task
- **`.command.sh`**: The command that was run by the process task call
- **`.exitcode`**: The exit code resulting from the command

These files are created by Nextflow to manage the execution of your pipeline. While these file are not required now, you may need to interrogate them to troubleshoot issues later.

!!!question "Exercise"

    Browse the `work` directory and view the `.command.sh` file

    ??? "Solution"

        _Note: The hash may be different to the example shown below._

        ```bash
        cat work/4e/6ba9138vhsbcbsc83bcka/.command.sh
        ```
